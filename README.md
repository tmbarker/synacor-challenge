# synacor-challenge
My C# .NET solution to the Synacor OSCON 2012 Challenge. The Synacor Challenge was issued by Eric Wastl (of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) fame) in 2012 and entails creating a virtual machine that adheres to a provided specification. As you implement your virtual machine you will discover codes, which in the past were to be entered on the challenge website, which is no longer available.
